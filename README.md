# Hardware components for home automation


### Setup
To fetch submodules, run the command:
```
$ git submodule update --init
```


### Edit circuits
To edit circuits, KiCad v5^ are required.
Libraries are configured in each component, due to poor library management in KiCad. - Common library structure are preferred.
